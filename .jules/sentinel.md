## 2026-02-03 - Establishing Security Baseline with Disconnected History
**Vulnerability:** Lack of foundational security configuration (gitignore, security policy) in the main branch.
**Learning:** Establishing a security baseline in this repository required merging branches with unrelated histories. Using GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting in SECURITY.md avoids hardcoding sensitive contact information.
**Prevention:** Always initialize new repositories with a standard security baseline including a robust .gitignore and a clear vulnerability disclosure policy.
